# Mach4 Macros for Cylindrical Autoleveling
The Mach4 macros contained in this are based off of those obtained on this
thread: (http://www.cncsoftwaretools.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=336).

# Known Issues
Ocassionally some of the A-axis values get repeated. Make sure to check
the output file and correct manually. The pre_probe_cylinder_plot.py
script is useful for visualizing the files.
