# Mach4 Macros for Probing
The Mach4 macros contained in this are based off of those obtained on [this
thread](http://www.cncsoftwaretools.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=336).
Thanks to Craig aka joeaverage on the [Mach Support Forum](machsupport.com/forum).

# Known Issues
Ocassionally some of the A-axis values get repeated. Make sure to check
the output file and correct manually. The pre_probe_cylinder_plot.py
script is useful for visualizing the files.
